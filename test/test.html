      This is a test page for the chemset.js library, which allows you to typeset
      chemical equations by writing them the way that you would type them in plain
      text.
      This block of text doesn't contain any chemical equations. I'm including it
      here so that it can show that the parser isn't finding false positives. It's
      also an introduction.

      H2SO4 (aq) is called sulfuric acid. H2NO4 (aq) is called nitric acid.
      HCl (aq) is called hydrochloric acid.
      The (aq) means it's a solution of acid.

    <p>
      H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) -> H2O (l) <br>
      Ba 2- (aq)
    </p>
    <p>
      2OH- (aq) + H+ (aq) --> O2H- (aq) <br>
      2Br(NO3)2
    </p>

      Here are some reactions from our most recent chemistry lab: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          KNO3 (aq) + NaCl (aq) --> KCl (aq) + NaNO3 (aq)
        </li>
        <li>
          Ba(NO3)2 (aq) + Na2SO4 (aq) --> 2NaNO3 (aq) + BaSO4 (s)
        </li>
      </ul>
      The latter of which has a net ionic equation of:
      Ba 2+ (aq) + SO4 2- (aq) -> BaSO4 (s)
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is a hydrated compound: <br>
      Na2HPO4.12H2O
    </p>
    <p>
      We should support other types of reactions besides plain produces. Here's
      a bi-directional reaction: H2O <--> H2O. Here's a stoichiometry reaction:
      H2O = H2O. Here's an equilibrium: H2O <==> H2O.
